## Description

- The volcano edifice is layered with decreasing velocity from base to the top of the volcano.
- The contrast between the s-wave velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock is systematically varied from 80% (low contrast, the magma has 80% of the surrounding s-wave velocity) to 10% (high contrast). 
- The higher the contrast, the clearer the scattering of the wave due to the magma chamber and pipe. 
- The resonance recorded at the stations at the top (center stations) is not observable if the contrast is 50% and 80%.
- By comparing the seismic sections with and without chamber and pipe, the scattering due to the layers only is not significant in this scenario.
- The resonance in the center of the receiver line is missing if the volcanic pipe is missing.
