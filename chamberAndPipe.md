## Descriptions
- The S-wave velocity of the magma is 30% of the surrounding rock.
- Simulations are performed without chamber and pipe, with chamber only and with both, chamber and pipe
- If the pipe is not included in the model, scattered waves are missing in the center of the receiver line (Fig. 1).
