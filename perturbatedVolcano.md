Description

The s- and p-wave velocity of the surrounding rock is perturbated by 5% (later varied)
The contrast between the s-wave velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock is systematically varied from 80% (low contrast) to 10% (high contrast). 
The higher the contrast, the clearer the scattering. 
The resonance recorded at the stations at the top (center stations) is not observable if the constrast is 0.5 and 0.8.
With increasing perturbation, the scattering of the seismic waves at the magma chamber and pipe becomes hidden in the scattering due to velocity perturbation.

Figure D: The contrast between magma and s-wave velocity is fixed to 30% (0.3), but the perturbation is now varied.
