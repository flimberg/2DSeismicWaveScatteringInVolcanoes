Description

The s- and p-wave velocity of surrounding rock is perturbated by 5%.
The contrast between the s-wave velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock is systematically varied from 80% (low contrast) to 10% (high contrast). 
The higher the contrast, the clearer the scattering. 
The resonance recorded at the stations at the top (center stations) is not observable if the constrast is 0.5 and 0.8.
