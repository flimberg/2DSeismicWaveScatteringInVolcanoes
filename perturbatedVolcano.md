Description

- The s- and p-wave velocity of the surrounding rock is perturbated by 5% (later varied).
- The contrast between the s-wave velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock is systematically varied from 80% (low contrast, the magma has 80% of the surrounding s-wave velocity) to 10% (high contrast). 
- The higher the contrast, the clearer the scattering of the wave due to the magma. 
- The resonance recorded at the stations at the top (center stations) is not observable if the constrast is 0.5 and 0.8.
- With increasing perturbation, the scattering of the seismic waves at the magma chamber and pipe becomes hidden in the scattering due to velocity perturbation.
- However, the resonance at the center stations is observable in all scenarios (even if perturbation is 50%). 
- The key parameter is rather the contrast between magma and rock, and the the general heterogenity of the rock.

Figure D: The contrast between magma and s-wave velocity is fixed to 30% (0.3), but the perturbation is now varied.
