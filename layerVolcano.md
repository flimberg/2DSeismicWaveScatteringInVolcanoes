Description

The volcano edifice is layer with decreasing velocity from base to the top of the volcano.
The contrast between the s-wave velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock is systematically varied from 80% (low contrast) to 10% (high contrast). 
The higher the contrast, the clearer the scattering of the wave at the magma chamber and pipe. 
The resonance recorded at the stations at the top (center stations) is not observable if the constrast is 50% and 80%.
