Our aim is to simulate the scattering of earthquake waves in a volcano due to a magmachamber.
The effect of the contrast between the seismic velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock as well as velocity perturbations of the surrounding rock are systematically studied.
Furthermore the effect of a layered volcano efidice is considered.



Check out the notebooks in this repository:

##### Benchmarks.md 
- First exemplary simple tests with animations of the wave propagation.


##### layeredVolcano.md
- The effect of layers in the volcano efidice. 
- The contrast between s-wave velocity of the magma and surrounding rock is systematically varied.


##### perturbedVolcano.md
- The effect of velocity perturbation in the volcano efidice. 
- Firstly, the contrast between s-wave velocity of the magma and surrounding rock is systematically varied.
- Secondly, the velocity perturbation of the surrounding rock is systematically varied.
