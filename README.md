Our aim is to simulate the scattering of earthquake waves in a volcano due to a magma chamber and volcanic pipe.
The effect of the contrast between the seismic velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock as well as velocity perturbations of the surrounding rock are systematically studied. Furthermore the effect of a layered volcano edifice is considered.

Check out the notebooks in this repository:

#### [perturbedVolcano.md](/perturbedVolcano.md) 
- The contrast between s-wave velocity of the magma and surrounding rock is systematically varied.
- The effect of velocity perturbation in the volcanic edifice is studied.
- The resolution of perturbation of the surrounding rock is systematically varied.


#### [layeredVolcano.md](/layeredVolcano.md)
- The effect of layers in the volcanic edifice is studied. 
- The contrast between s-wave velocity of the magma and surrounding rock is systematically varied.
- Wave fields that include chamber, chamber+pipe or none of the structures are compared.

#### [sourceLocations.md](/sourceLocations.md)
- Simulations with four different locations of the source (deep down, directly under the chamber, next to the chamber, at the top)

#### [benchmarks.md](/benchmarks.md) 
- First exemplary simple tests with animations of the wave propagation through a volcanic system.
