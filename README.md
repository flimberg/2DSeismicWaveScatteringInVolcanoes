# 2DVolcanoAndSeismicWaves

We investigate the scattering of seismic waves due to a magma chamber and pipe of a volcano based on numerical simulations.
The contrast betweent seismic velocities of the magma and surrounding rock as well as velocity perurbations are systematically studied.
Furthermore the effect of a layer volcano efidice is simulated.

Check out these notebooks:

##### Benchmarks.md 
- First exemplary simple tests with animations of the wave propagation.


##### layerVolcano.md
- The effect of layers in the volcano efidice. 
- The contrast between s-wave velocity of the magma and surrounding rock is systematically varied.


##### perturbedVolcano.md
- The effect of velocity perturbation in the volcano efidice. 
- Firstly, the contrast between s-wave velocity of the magma and surrounding rock is systematically varied.
- Secondly, the velocity perturbation of the surrounding rock is systematically varied.
