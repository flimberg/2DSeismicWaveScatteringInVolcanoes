# 2DVolcanoAndSeismicWaves

We simulate the scattering of earthquake waves due to a magma chamber and pipe in a volcano.
The contrast between the seismic velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock as well as velocity perturbations of the surrounding rock are systematically studied.
Furthermore the effect of a layered volcano efidice is considered.

Check out these notebooks:

##### Benchmarks.md 
- First exemplary simple tests with animations of the wave propagation.


##### layerVolcano.md
- The effect of layers in the volcano efidice. 
- The contrast between s-wave velocity of the magma and surrounding rock is systematically varied.


##### perturbedVolcano.md
- The effect of velocity perturbation in the volcano efidice. 
- Firstly, the contrast between s-wave velocity of the magma and surrounding rock is systematically varied.
- Secondly, the velocity perturbation of the surrounding rock is systematically varied.
