I set up a simple 2D model to study the effect of a magma chamber (with a low shear wave velocity) on the seismic waves propagating through a vulcano. The waves source is an earthquake in a depth of 5 km and is modeled by a Ricker-wavelet with a center frequency of 2 Hz. A very dense line of receivers at the surface allows to extract the synthetic seismograms. The scattering of the waves is nicely observable. Please find the results below...
