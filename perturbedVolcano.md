## Description

- The s- and p-wave velocity of the surrounding rock is perturbed by 5% (later varied) (Fig. 1).
- The contrast between the s-wave velocity of the magma and the surrounding rock is systematically varied from 80% (low contrast, the magma has 80% of the surrounding s-wave velocity) to 10% (high contrast). 
- The higher the contrast, the clearer the scattering of the wave due to the magma (Fig. 2). 
- The resonance recorded at the stations at the top (center stations) is not observable if the constrast is 0.8 (Fig. 2).
- With increasing perturbation, the scattering due to the magma chamber and pipe becomes hidden in the scattering due to velocity perturbation (Fig. 3).
- However, the resonance at the center stations is implied in all scenarios (even if perturbation is 50%) (Fig. 3). 
- The key parameter is rather the contrast between magma and rock, and not the general heterogenity of the rock.
- If the pipe is not included in the model, scattered waves are missing in the center of the receiver line (Fig. 4).
