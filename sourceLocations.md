## Description

- No velocity perturbation.
- The magma has a S-wave velocity of 30 % of the surrounding rock.
- Sources are located at various positions.
- Scattering due to the magma chamber seems to be measured better, if the source is located somewhere beneath the chamber and not in the efidice.
