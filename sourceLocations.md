## Description

- No velocity perturbation of the surrounding rock.
- The magma has a S-wave velocity of 30 % of the surrounding rock.
- Sources are located at four different positions (A,B,C and D).
- Scattering due to the magma chamber seems to be measured better, if the source is located somewhere beneath the chamber (A,B) and not in the efidice (C,D).
